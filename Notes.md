### Moving on the line

These key chords behave different in different apps.

In VS Code, they move both the display and where text is inserted. In some
documents, they seem to move based on document structure. For example, in this
Markdown document, `Control`+ down-arrow can move to the last section and, in
that case, pressing these keys a second time move to the bottom of the document.

In Notes, they move what text is displayed but do not move where text is
inserted.

- `Fn` + `right-arrow`: In VS Code, this moves the cursor to the end of line but in
  the Notes app, this displays the end of line but does *not* change the text
  insertion point.
- `Fn` + `left-arrow`: Depends on the app, Moves the cursor to the beginning of the
  line.
- `Fn` + `down-arrow`: Moves to the bottom of the window or document.
- `Fn` + `up-arrow`: Moves to the top of the window or document.
